## Unreleased

## 0.1.0-alpha.0 — 2026-11-01

First public alpha, published under the `alpha` dist-tag: `npm install @inkbrick/react@alpha`. The API may change
between alpha releases.

### Features

- Block editor on a single `contenteditable` root: paragraphs, headings, lists (bullet, ordered, tasks, nesting),
  quotes, code with syntax highlighting, callouts, dividers, images, block and inline formulas.
- Text formats, links, colors, highlight, alignment; floating toolbar, slash menu, block handles and menu,
  drag and drop (mouse and touch), keyboard shortcuts (`keymap`).
- Transactions with undo/redo, read-only mode, clipboard (plain text, HTML, exact Inkbrick fragments; Word and
  Google Docs markup), export to Markdown, HTML and text.
- Schemas with roles, nesting rules, versions and migrations; `repairSnapshot` for damaged documents.
- Customization: `presentation`, `components`, `slots`, custom blocks with controllers (`defineBlock`),
  data-attribute styling contract with themes, i18n (en, ru, custom dictionaries).
- Virtual renderer for large documents; mobile input (IME) support.

### Added

- Coverage thresholds (`pnpm test:coverage`), bundle size budget (`pnpm size`), scaling tests against quadratic
  algorithms, end-to-end tests in Firefox and WebKit.
- `LICENSE`, `SECURITY.md` (threat model, CSP), `CONTRIBUTING.md`, English README, API reference (`pnpm docs:api`).

### Changed

- The project is renamed from Qubi to Inkbrick: packages `@inkbrick/*`, `data-inkbrick-*` attributes, `--inkbrick-*` design tokens and the `application/x-inkbrick-fragment` clipboard type.
- The formula symbol palette and the MathML styles load lazily with the first formula: the eager bundle of
  `@inkbrick/react` is ~4 KB (gzip) smaller.
- Ctrl/Alt+Backspace keeps the space before the deleted word, like browsers and word processors.
- Toolchain: Vite 7, Vitest 4, ESLint 10, Playwright 1.64; `zod` ≥ 4.6.7 (security fix).

### Fixed

- Backspace at the start and Delete at the end of a block did nothing in Safari (WebKit sends no `beforeinput`
  there).
- Pasting deeply nested HTML was slow (the block-detection scan walked the whole subtree at every level).
